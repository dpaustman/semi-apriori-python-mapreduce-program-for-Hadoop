# Python MapReduce Program for Hadoop in Semi-Apriori Style

This is a simple python mapreduce program aiming to find frequent patterns.  
I'm currently a student studying data science so I tried to make things more comprehensible to other beginners like me.  
  
# Usage

1. Set up a single/multi node Hadoop cluster.  
For beginners, please check Michael G. Noll's [Running Hadoop on Ubuntu Linux (Single-Node Cluster)](http://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/running-hadoop-on-ubuntu-linux-single-node-cluster/) and [Writing an Hadoop MapReduce Program in Python](http://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/writing-an-hadoop-mapreduce-program-in-python/). Those are great tutorials and my code are mostly edit vesion of his.  
Many thanks to him.
